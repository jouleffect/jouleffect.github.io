This project was realized for the "Complex Networks" course, hold at the Department of Information Technology of University of Palermo.<br>

The goal is to analyze the time evoulition of epidemics spread, based on the SEIRD model.<br>
The population is rapresented by a random network (Poisson Erdos-Renyi), generated by choosing a fixed number of nodes and a fixed 
edge probabiltity between them. 

<p><h3>This is the schema of the epidemic states used in the model:</h3></p>

</p>

A Susceptible node can be catch the disease if it has an edge with an Exposed or Infected one. <br>
If it happens, the node becomes Exposed for a specific time, after which it becomes automatically Infected. <br>
During the Infection period, the node could become Recovered, but also it could fall in the Severe Infected state. <br>
If the node falls in the Severe Infected state, there is a probability that it could die.<br>
Note that, the node in the Dead state is not removed from the network, but it is just not taken in account for the rest of the next steps.<br>
<br>
The scripts of the program are the following:

- main.py
- model.py
- simulator.py

In the main script, in addition to the GUI objects, there is a function with this lines:

```python
def start_sim():
  sim = simulator.Simulator()
  net = model.Network(sim)
  for i in range(sim.num_iter):
    net.update_states(i,sim)
    net.t_state = net.t_state + sim.dt_state
    new_cases = net.get_new_cases(i,sim)
    sim.s_to_e(net,new_cases)
    sim.e_to_i(net)
    sim.i_to_r(net)
    sim.i_to_ig(net,i)
    sim.ig_to_d(net,i)

  if i>=plot_freq and i%plot_freq==0:
  p = net.plot(i,sim)
```



<h3>HOW TO INSTALL:</h3> 

- Download the zip file from GitHub.
- install requirements:

<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>

<h3> HOW TO RUN:</h3>

Run the script:

<pre><code>python3 main.py</code></pre>

The GUI will open and you can start to use the simulator.
